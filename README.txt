Tested on XAMPP (Windows 10)

Simple php scripts.

Each script has own config file:
create.json
copy.json
compare.json

Usage (run from php bin directory):

1) create table with UUID
php E:\htdocs\uuid\create.php

2) copy between DB and tables
php e:\xampp\htdocs\uuid.local\copy.php

3) compare between tables
php e:\xampp\htdocs\uuid.local\compare.php
