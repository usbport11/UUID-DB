Generate, copy, compare uuid tables using php.


Each script has own config file:

php e:\xampp\htdocs\uuid\create.php

2) copy from one table to another (select data from source table and insert into destination table)
php e:\xampp\htdocs\uuid.local\copy.php

3) compare between tables (print out unique items)
php e:\xampp\htdocs\uuid.local\compare.php
